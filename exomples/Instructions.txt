Hello

Make mod

1 - Make info.json
2 - Make data.lua and require all the other files you need
	You can put all the other files in a folder if you want, but then you have to require them differently.
	If you put "sap.lua" in the folder "prototypes" then you would write require("prototypes.sap")

3 - Make the stuff for the game. 
	Titan.lua has an example ore and all the stuff you need for that.
	fluid-plant.lua is an example crafting machine.
	item_and_fluid.lua shows how to make an item or a fluid.
	water-processing.lua is an example recipe.

4 - So, to make the everything work:
	Make all the items and fluids.
	Make all the recipes, setting them to have the right sort of crafting categories.
	Make the crafting categories if you invented any new ones.
	Make the crafting machine, setting it to have the right sort of crafting categories to do all the recipes.
	data:extend them all

5 - data:extend{the_item_you_want, the_other_thing, etc}

6 - if there is an error womp womp, probably a random comma or } in the wrong place.
	"Unexpected character near ..." could mean you've missed a comma in a list of stuff
	"Expected } near " means the number of brackets is wrong - it tells you what line to look on but sometimes the problem is on a different line. Again, can mean you've missed a comma.

	If it tells you it can't find something its probably that its typed wrong or not added to extend
	No errors means you forgot to run the code

7 - if the text is goofy, add the thing you want to the .cfg file.
	eg Unknown Key: "recipe-name.sap-sea-water-cleaning" means you need
		[recipe-name]
		sap-sea-water-cleaning=Sea Water Cleaning


Extra bonus fun:
	if you want the thing in a different place in the inventory screen, set its subgroup and order to put it in the right place.
	- see subgroups.lua
